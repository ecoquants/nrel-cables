Category,DescriptionNonliving Resources ,"data are about chemical, physical, or geological features that are of use or importance to humans or ecologies. This broad, top-level category of data content subjects includes three subcategories: “Energy Resources,” “Material Resources,” and “Physical/Chemical Features.” Each of these includes several sublevels. These are defined in greater detail to further describe the data content types needed for each subject."Energy Resources ,"efers to natural features that provide a capacity to do work through combustion, movement, radiation, or heat; these resources include oil, natural gas, coal, wind, sun, currents, tides, and natural heat gradients. Distributions are recorded observations, maps, or models of specified resources at known locations, in some cases as a function of season or other temporal scales. Assessments are evaluations of the economic or ecological value associated with the resources or of the difficulty, environmental effects, or sustainability of energy extraction and production. Some assessments can appropriately be included in the “Energy Resources” category and also in related “Living Resources” or “Uses” categories. Predictions are the results of models or projections of future distributions, values, or impacts of energy resources; these data include forecasts of changes due to natural and human processes, such as resource losses or gains under different rates of resource extraction, effects of climate change, and so on. The “Energy Resources” subcategory includes eight sublevels. "Oil Resources ,"refers to deposits of valuable liquid hydrocarbons or fossil fuels. Distributions are geologic maps, models, and observations that indicate location, volume, and geochemical composition of underground deposits. Assessments evaluate locations, methods, and profitability of oil extraction and transportation; environmental impacts; and interactions with other uses. Predictions are the results of models or projections of future oil reserves based on extraction or natural processes, or they are predicted changes in profitability and risk due to economic, regulatory, technological, and environmental changes. "Natural Gas Resources ,"refers to stocks of naturally formed hydrocarbon gases, which are usually associated with petroleum fields or gas hydrate formations. Distributions are geologic maps, models, and other observations that indicate locations and volumes of underground stocks. Assessments evaluate locations, methods, and profitability of gas extraction and transportation; environmental impacts; and (or) other interactions with other uses. Predictions are the results of models or projections of future gas reserves based on projected extraction, or they are predicted changes in profitability and risk due to economic, regulatory, technological, and environmental changes.
