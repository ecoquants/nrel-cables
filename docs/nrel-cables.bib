These sources have the potential to help alleviate the global climate change threat, but the ocean environment should be protected while these technologies are developed. Renewable energy sources from the ocean may be exploited without harming the marine environment if projects are sited and scaled appropriately and environmental guidelines are followed.},

Since 2000, a number of large-scale wave and tidal current prototypes have been demonstrated around the world, but marine renewable energy technology is still 10\textendash{}15 years behind that of wind energy. UK-based developers are leading the way, with Pelamis from Pelamis Wave Power demonstrated in the open sea, generating electricity into the UK network and securing orders from Portugal. However, having started later, the developing technology can make use of more advanced science and engineering, and it is therefore reasonable to expect rapid progress. Although progress is underway through deployment and testing, there are still key scientific challenges to be addressed in areas including resource assessment and predictability, engineering design and manufacturability, installation, operation and maintenance, survivability, reliability and cost reduction. The research priorities required to meet these challenges are suggested in this paper and have been drawn from current roadmaps and vision documents, including more recent consultations within the community by the UK Energy Research Centre Marine Research Network. Many scientific advances are required to meet these challenges, and their likelihood is explored based on current and future capabilities.},

In this paper, economic issues concerning costs in pre-investment and investment stages for offshore wind farms exploiting alternating-current transmission system are analysed. Single cost centres are detailed, taking into account technical features and current equipment exploitation. The aim is to formulate a general model to evaluate the total investment depending on wind farm layout. The model is employed to determine the most suitable connection solution for a 150-MW test wind farm, accounting for different connection schemes and the presence of an offshore or onshore substation. Further tests are run to evaluate cost variation for larger wind farms with different nominal voltage levels.},

Research in this area is driven by the need to meet renewable energy targets, but is relatively immature compared to other renewable energy technologies. This review introduces the general status of wave energy and evaluates the device types that represent current wave energy converter (WEC) technology, particularly focusing on work being undertaken within the United Kingdom. The possible power take-off systems are identified, followed by a consideration of some of the control strategies to enhance the efficiency of point absorber-type WECs. There is a lack of convergence on the best method of extracting energy from the waves and, although previous innovation has generally focused on the concept and design of the primary interface, questions arise concerning how best to optimize the powertrain.

  abstract = {* 1Global-scale environmental degradation and its links with non-renewable fossil fuels have led to an increasing interest in generating electricity from renewable energy resources. Much of this interest centres on offshore renewable energy developments (ORED). The large scale of proposed ORED will add to the existing human pressures on coastal ecosystems, therefore any ecological costs and benefits must be determined.
* 2The current pressures on coastal ecology set the context within which the potential impacts (both positive and negative) of offshore renewable energy generation are discussed.
* 3The number of published peer-review articles relating to renewable energy has increased dramatically since 1991. Significantly, only a small proportion of these articles relate to environmental impacts and none considers coastal ecology.
* 4Actual or potential environmental impact can occur during construction, operation and/or decommissioning of ORED.
* 5Construction and decommissioning are likely to cause significant physical disturbance to the local environment. There are both short- and long-term implications for the local biological communities. The significance of any effects is likely to depend on the natural disturbance regime and the stability and resilience of the communities.
* 6During day-to-day operation, underwater noise, emission of electromagnetic fields and collision or avoidance with the energy structures represent further potential impacts on coastal species, particularly large predators. The wider ecological implications of any direct and indirect effects are discussed.
* 7Synthesis and applications. This review demonstrates that offshore renewable energy developments will have direct and, potentially, indirect consequences for coastal ecology, with these effects occurring at different scales. Ecologists should be involved throughout all the phases of an ORED to ensure that appropriate assessments of the interaction of single and multiple developments with the coastal environment are undertaken.},

In response, many governments have initiated programmes of energy production from renewable sources. 2.\hspace{0.6em}The marine environment presents a relatively untapped energy source and offshore installations are likely to produce a significant proportion of future energy production. Wind power is the most advanced, with development of wave and tidal energy conversion devices expected to increase worldwide in the near future. 3.\hspace{0.6em}Concerns over the potential impacts on biodiversity of marine renewable energy installations (MREI) include: habitat loss, collision risks, noise and electromagnetic fields.

MREI have the potential to be both detrimental and beneficial to the environment but the evidence base remains limited. To allow for full biodiversity impacts to be assessed, there exists an urgent need for additional multi and inter-disciplinary research in this area ranging from engineering to policy. Whilst there are a number of factors to be considered, one of the key decisions facing current policy makers is where installations should be sited, and, dependent upon site, whether they should be designed to either minimize negative environmental impacts or as facilitators of ecosystem restoration.},

This paper reviews an ecosystem service tradeoff analysis framework and provides a more comprehensive synthesis for how it can be applied to marine spatial planning and marine ecosystem-based management.

The effects of the farm on the coast, which can be instrumental in mitigating storm-induced erosion and thus contribute to coastal defence, are sometimes disregarded in selecting its location, possibly due to the inexistence of an ad hoc methodology. In this context, the objective of this work is to examine the influence of the farm-to-coast distance through a sensitivity analysis in a case study: Perranporth (UK). The impacts of a wave farm on the beach morphology are examined in four scenarios with different farm-to-coast distances using a high-resolution suite of numerical models. The results show that a wave farm closest to the beach offers the highest degree of coastal protection (up to 20\% of beach erosion reduction). The downside of this enhanced coastal protection is that the wave resource available at this location would be slightly smaller (approx. 10\%) than in the case of the wave farms further from the coast. More generally, we find that the farm-to-coast distance is a critical variable in determining the effectiveness of a wave farm for coastal defence.},

For coastal areas or some remote islands, marine tidal current energy is a promising renewable power source due to its high predictability. During the last decades, prototypes of various horizontal and vertical axis marine current turbines (MCT) have been developed around the world. Although reviews on MCTs can be found in some state-of-the-art research papers in the last few years, many of the reported MCT projects were only at the planning/design stage when the papers were written. In fact, some projects do not have any further developments during the several years after their first reporting; and others have already upgraded their original designs and adopted up-scaled versions. In this paper, up-to-date information on large tidal turbine projects over 500 kW is focused. The newest achievements of these large tidal current turbine technologies with their developing histories are presented. These technologies represent the industrial solutions for several pre-commercial MCT farm projects in the coming years. New developments in floating MCT technologies are also included. This paper provides a useful background for researchers in the tidal current energy domain and allows them to know the newest developments in large MCT projects around world.},

Countries with coastal regions have the advantage of the ability to utilize an extra source of renewable energy, that is, the energy from ocean waves. However, one of the major problems with wave energy is that it is location dependent, where many factors that increase its utilization potential are dependent on the feasibility of the locations. There is a lack of objective, relative and cognitive methods for the estimation of location suitability for ocean wave energy production. The present study attempts to address this lacuna and proposes a new method which is both objective and cognitive to identify suitable locations where the optimal amount of wave energy can be produced. The proposed method used the MCDM cascaded to ANN techniques to predict an index that directly represents the suitability of locations for wave energy generation. The index was applied to two different locations with varied levels of wave energy potential. The results encourage the authors for further application of the method.},

  abstract = {In this paper, five most emerging renewable energy sources are analyzed. These emerging renewables are either special or advanced forms of the mainstream energy sources (solar, wind, geothermal, biofuels, biomass, and hydro) or brand new technologies. The five emerging renewable technologies discussed in this paper include marine energy, concentrated solar photovoltaics (CSP), enhanced geothermal energy (EGE), cellulosic ethanol, and artificial photosynthesis. Marine energy is divided into wave energy, tidal energy, tidal/ocean currents, salinity gradient, and ocean thermal energy conversion. CSP technologies are divided into parabolic troughs, linear Fresnel reflectors, parabolic dishes, and solar towers. The process for developing EGE reservoirs is also explained in detail. Cellulosic ethanol energy extraction is explained for both cellulolysis and gasification. Artificial photosynthesis is explained by considering semiconductor particles, electrolyzers, artificial leaves, and dye-synthesized solar cells. Each emerging renewable source's explanation is followed by its market share, challenges, implications for increased adoption, future prospects, and drawbacks.},

  abstract = {Assessing and managing the cumulative impacts of human activities on the environment remains a major challenge to sustainable development. This challenge is highlighted by the worldwide expansion of marine renewable energy developments (MREDs) in areas already subject to multiple activities and climate change. Cumulative effects assessments in theory provide decision makers with adequate information about how the environment will respond to the incremental effects of licensed activities and are a legal requirement in many nations. In practise, however, such assessments are beset by uncertainties resulting in substantial delays during the licensing process that reduce MRED investor confidence and limit progress towards meeting climate change targets. In light of these targets and ambitions to manage the marine environment sustainably, reducing the uncertainty surrounding MRED effects and cumulative effects assessment are timely and vital. This review investigates the origins and evolution of cumulative effects assessment to identify why the multitude of approaches and pertinent research have emerged, and discusses key considerations and challenges relevant to assessing the cumulative effects of MREDs and other activities on ecosystems. The review recommends a shift away from the current reliance on disparate environmental impact assessments and limited strategic environmental assessments, and a move towards establishing a common system of coordinated data and research relative to ecologically meaningful areas, focussed on the needs of decision makers tasked with protecting and conserving marine ecosystems and services.},

  abstract = {Multi-use offshore platforms (MUPs) combining renewable energy from the sea, aquaculture and transportation facilities can be considered as a challenging way to boost blue growth and make renewable energy (especially wave energy) environmentally and socio-economically sustainable. MUPs allow sharing the financial and other market/non-market costs of installation and management, locally using the produced energy for different functionalities and optimizing marine spatial planning. The design of these solutions is a complex interdisciplinary challenge, involving scientists and technical experts with different backgrounds.
This paper presents a new methodology for the design of a MUP based on technical, environmental, social and economic criteria. The methodology consists of four steps: a pre-screening phase, to assess the feasibility of different maritime uses at the site; a preliminary design of the alternative schemes based on the identified maritime uses; a ranking phase, where the performance of the MUPs is scored by means of expert judgment of the selected criteria; a preliminary design of the selected MUP selected.
An example application of this procedure to a site offshore the Western Sardinia coast, Mediterranean Sea, Italy, is provided. In this site the deployment of a MUP consisting of wave energy converters, offshore wind turbines and aquaculture is specifically investigated.},

  abstract = {For Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) to become a viable alternative energy source, it must encompass large arrays of devices. Arrays may include 1000s of devices. The associated foundations or anchors may encounter a range of seafloor sediment types and geotechnical properties. Wave and tidal energy convertors induce unique loads on foundations and anchors that are different from other seafloor engineering applications. Thus, there is a need for a combination of advanced site analysis and performance assessment. Geotechnical engineering plays the vital role of ensuring that foundation and anchor systems perform successfully for MRE devices. Our paper reviews the unique frequency and magnitude of loading regimes experienced by MRE arrays. We examine potential loading conditions on the foundation-anchor systems. Loading regimes include environmental and system loads from single devices or arrays of devices. We present specific load examples from field data. We explore the applicable geotechnical approaches to address these conditions, including constitutive models that may or may not adequately capture the response of the seafloor sediments to the MRE loads. Partially to fully dynamic constitutive model formulations may be necessary to properly model sediment-fluid hydromechanical response to MRE loading. Spacing of full MRE arrays and spatial variability in sediment properties may require multiple foundation types.},

  abstractnote = {This project estimates the naturally available and technically recoverable U.S. wave energy resources, using a 51-month Wavewatch III hindcast database developed especially for this study by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA's) National Centers for Environmental Prediction. For total resource estimation, wave power density in terms of kilowatts per meter is aggregated across a unit diameter circle. This approach is fully consistent with accepted global practice and includes the resource made available by the lateral transfer of wave energy along wave crests, which enables wave diffraction to substantially reestablish wave power densities within a few kilometers of a linear array, even for fixed terminator devices. The total available wave energy resource along the U.S. continental shelf edge, based on accumulating unit circle wave power densities, is estimated to be 2,640 TWh/yr, broken down as follows: 590 TWh/yr for the West Coast, 240 TWh/yr for the East Coast, 80 TWh/yr for the Gulf of Mexico, 1570 TWh/yr for Alaska, 130 TWh/yr for Hawaii, and 30 TWh/yr for Puerto Rico. The total recoverable wave energy resource, as constrained by an array capacity packing density of 15 megawatts per kilometer of coastline, with a 100-fold operating range between threshold and maximum operating conditions in terms of input wave power density available to such arrays, yields a total recoverable resource along the U.S. continental shelf edge of 1,170 TWh/yr, broken down as follows: 250 TWh/yr for the West Coast, 160 TWh/yr for the East Coast, 60 TWh/yr for the Gulf of Mexico, 620 TWh/yr for Alaska, 80 TWh/yr for Hawaii, and 20 TWh/yr for Puerto Rico.}

  abstract = {If Scottish Government targets are met, the equivalent of 100\% of Scotland's electricity demand will be generated from renewable sources by 2020. There are several possible risks posed to seabirds from marine renewable energy installations (MREIs) and many knowledge gaps still exist around the extent to which seabird habitats can overlap with MREIs. In this study, underlying seasonal and interannual variation in seabird distributions was investigated using kernel density estimation (KDE) to identify areas of core habitat use. This allowed the potential interactions between seabirds and a wave energy converter (WEC) to be assessed. The distributions of four seabird species were compared between seasons, years, and in the presence and absence of WECs. Although substantial interannual variation existed in baseline years prior to WEC deployment, the KDEs for all four species analysed were closer to the mooring points in the presence of a WEC in at least one season. The KDEs for all four species also increased in area in at least one season in the presence of a WEC. The KDEs of the northern fulmar and great skua overlapped the mooring points during spring in the presence of a device. The density of observations close to the mooring points increased for great skua, northern gannet, and northern fulmar during summer in the presence of a device. These results suggest that none of the four species analysed have shown avoidance or an extreme change in distribution as a result of the presence of a WEC. The continued monitoring of seabirds during WEC deployments is necessary to provide further data on how distributions may change in response to the presence of WECs.},

  abstract = {Multi-use offshore platforms (MUPs) combining renewable energy from the sea, aquaculture and transportation facilities can be considered as a challenging way to boost blue growth and make renewable energy (especially wave energy) environmentally and socio-economically sustainable. MUPs allow sharing the financial and other market/non-market costs of installation and management, locally using the produced energy for different functionalities and optimizing marine spatial planning. The design of these solutions is a complex interdisciplinary challenge, involving scientists and technical experts with different backgrounds. This paper presents a new methodology for the design of a MUP based on technical, environmental, social and economic criteria. The methodology consists of four steps: a pre-screening phase, to assess the feasibility of different maritime uses at the site; a preliminary design of the alternative schemes based on the identified maritime uses; a ranking phase, where the performance of the MUPs is scored by means of expert judgment of the selected criteria; a preliminary design of the selected MUP selected. An example application of this procedure to a site offshore the Western Sardinia coast, Mediterranean Sea, Italy, is provided. In this site the deployment of a MUP consisting of wave energy converters, offshore wind turbines and aquaculture is specifically investigated.},

In addition, and specifically for the United States, resource locations with high wave power are close to major load centers being located along coastlines. These features have sparked a surge of attention in the United States on trying to economically harness ocean wave power. The aim of this article is to provide a concise review of the current state of ocean wave energy conversion technologies and industry status in the United States including research and development as well as commercial activities and governmental support, concluding with a discussion of future industry perspectives. Existing facilities, softwares as well as laboratory and open-water test facilities and resources, active research groups and commercial activities have been identified. Over one third of commercially active wave energy developers worldwide are located within the United States, but only a few have reached a high Technology Readiness Level. These findings, together with a relevant practical resource located within the U.S. and the advantageous nature of the resource compared to other renewable resources, indicate that the United States is well positioned to advance the wave energy industry in the near future.},

  abstract = {This study addresses the greatest concern facing the large-scale integration of wind, water, and solar (WWS) into a power grid: the high cost of avoiding load loss caused by WWS variability and uncertainty. It uses a new grid integration model and finds low-cost, no-load-loss, nonunique solutions to this problem on electrification of all US energy sectors (electricity, transportation, heating/cooling, and industry) while accounting for wind and solar time series data from a 3D global weather model that simulates extreme events and competition among wind turbines for available kinetic energy. Solutions are obtained by prioritizing storage for heat (in soil and water); cold (in ice and water); and electricity (in phase-change materials, pumped hydro, hydropower, and hydrogen), and using demand response. No natural gas, biofuels, nuclear power, or stationary batteries are needed. The resulting 2050\textendash{}2055 US electricity social cost for a full system is much less than for fossil fuels. These results hold for many conditions, suggesting that low-cost, reliable 100\% WWS systems should work many places worldwide.},

GEBCO\_2014 has a grid spacing of 30\,arc sec and updates the 2010 release (GEBCO\_08) by incorporating new versions of regional bathymetric compilations from the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean, the International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean, the Baltic Sea Bathymetry Database, and data from the European Marine Observation and Data network bathymetry portal, among other data sources. Approximately 33\% of ocean grid cells (not area) have been updated in GEBCO\_2014 from the previous version, including both new interpolated depth values and added soundings. These updates include large amounts of multibeam data collected using modern equipment and navigation techniques, improving portrayed details of the world ocean floor. Of all nonland grid cells in GEBCO\_2014, approximately 18\% are based on bathymetric control data, i.e., primarily multibeam and single-beam soundings or preprepared grids which may contain some interpolated values. The GEBCO\_2014 grid has a mean and median depth of 3897\,m and 3441\,m, respectively. Hypsometric analysis reveals that 50\% of the Earth's surface is composed of seafloor located 3200\,m below mean sea level and that \textasciitilde{}900 ship years of surveying would be needed to obtain complete multibeam coverage of the world's oceans.},

  abstract = {There has never been a more exciting time for o shore wind in the United States. By the end of 2015, the U.S. Depart- ment of the Interior awarded 11 commercial leases for o shore wind development that could support a total of 14.6 gigawatts of capacity. In May 2016, the U.S. Department of Energy identi ed three innovative demonstration projects that have made signi cant progress toward producing power. In addition to these noteworthy achievements, we are looking forward to the  rst commercial o shore wind energy facility in the United States\textemdash{}the Block Island Wind Farm\textemdash{}beginning commercial operation before the close of 2016.
With almost 80\% of U.S. electricity demand located in coastal states and total o shore wind energy technical poten- tial equal to about double the nation's demand for electricity, o shore wind energy has the potential to contribute signi cantly to a clean, a ordable, and secure national energy mix. Realizing the potential of o shore wind energy in the United States will require addressing key challenges in technology and cost, supporting e ective stewardship of our natural resources, and increasing understanding of o shore wind's bene ts and costs.
Our agencies are uniquely poised to provide leadership in addressing these key challenges. Recognizing the signi - cant opportunity for our nation, we have worked closely together and solicited signi cant public input over the past 18 months to compose a joint national o shore wind strategy. This report highlights the potential value of o shore wind to the nation, and presents a credible set of approaches and actions to facilitate the responsible development of a U.S. o shore wind industry.
On behalf of the o ces we represent, we express our deep gratitude to the hundreds of individuals across federal and state governments, industry, academia, research institutions, and the environmental community for their meaningful contributions to this national strategy for o shore wind. Their expertise, vision, and passion herald a bright future for o shore wind energy in the United States.
We are con dent that our nation stands at the forefront of a strong domestic o shore wind industry. It is our hope that this document will continue to serve as a guide for key decision-makers within our agencies, as well as within the broader o shore wind energy community, over the next 5 years and beyond.

By describing specific tools and how we incrementally began using them for the Ocean Health Index project, we hope to encourage others in the scientific community to do the same-so we can all produce better science in less time.},

  abstract = {Many companies have proprietary resources and/or data that are indispensable for research, and academics provide the creative fuel for much early-stage research that leads to industrial innovation. It is essential to the health of the research enterprise that collaborations between industrial and university researchers flourish. This system of collaboration is under strain. Financial motivations driving product development have led to concerns that industry-sponsored research comes at the expense of transparency (1). Yet many industry researchers distrust quality control in academia (2) and question whether academics value reproducibility as much as rapid publication. Cultural differences between industry and academia can create or increase difficulties in reproducing research findings. We discuss key aspects of this problem that industry-academia collaborations must address and for which other stakeholders, from funding agencies to journals, can provide leadership and support.
