The ocean provides a vast source of potential energy resources, and as renewable energy technology develops, investment in ocean energy is likely to grow. Research in ocean thermal energy conversion, wave energy, tidal energy, and offshore wind energy has led to promising technologies and in some cases, commercial deployment. These sources have the potential to help alleviate the global climate change threat, but the ocean environment should be protected while these technologies are developed. Renewable energy sources from the ocean may be exploited without harming the marine environment if projects are sited and scaled appropriately and environmental guidelines are followed.},

Since 2000, a number of large-scale wave and tidal current prototypes have been demonstrated around the world, but marine renewable energy technology is still 10\textendash{}15 years behind that of wind energy. UK-based developers are leading the way, with Pelamis from Pelamis Wave Power demonstrated in the open sea, generating electricity into the UK network and securing orders from Portugal. However, having started later, the developing technology can make use of more advanced science and engineering, and it is therefore reasonable to expect rapid progress. Although progress is underway through deployment and testing, there are still key scientific challenges to be addressed in areas including resource assessment and predictability, engineering design and manufacturability, installation, operation and maintenance, survivability, reliability and cost reduction. The research priorities required to meet these challenges are suggested in this paper and have been drawn from current roadmaps and vision documents, including more recent consultations within the community by the UK Energy Research Centre Marine Research Network. Many scientific advances are required to meet these challenges, and their likelihood is explored based on current and future capabilities.},

In this paper, economic issues concerning costs in pre-investment and investment stages for offshore wind farms exploiting alternating-current transmission system are analysed. Single cost centres are detailed, taking into account technical features and current equipment exploitation. The aim is to formulate a general model to evaluate the total investment depending on wind farm layout. The model is employed to determine the most suitable connection solution for a 150-MW test wind farm, accounting for different connection schemes and the presence of an offshore or onshore substation. Further tests are run to evaluate cost variation for larger wind farms with different nominal voltage levels.},

Research in this area is driven by the need to meet renewable energy targets, but is relatively immature compared to other renewable energy technologies. This review introduces the general status of wave energy and evaluates the device types that represent current wave energy converter (WEC) technology, particularly focusing on work being undertaken within the United Kingdom. The possible power take-off systems are identified, followed by a consideration of some of the control strategies to enhance the efficiency of point absorber-type WECs. There is a lack of convergence on the best method of extracting energy from the waves and, although previous innovation has generally focused on the concept and design of the primary interface, questions arise concerning how best to optimize the powertrain. This article concludes with some suggestions of future developments.},

  abstract = {* 1Global-scale environmental degradation and its links with non-renewable fossil fuels have led to an increasing interest in generating electricity from renewable energy resources. Much of this interest centres on offshore renewable energy developments (ORED). The large scale of proposed ORED will add to the existing human pressures on coastal ecosystems, therefore any ecological costs and benefits must be determined.
* 2The current pressures on coastal ecology set the context within which the potential impacts (both positive and negative) of offshore renewable energy generation are discussed.
* 3The number of published peer-review articles relating to renewable energy has increased dramatically since 1991. Significantly, only a small proportion of these articles relate to environmental impacts and none considers coastal ecology.
* 4Actual or potential environmental impact can occur during construction, operation and/or decommissioning of ORED.
* 5Construction and decommissioning are likely to cause significant physical disturbance to the local environment. There are both short- and long-term implications for the local biological communities. The significance of any effects is likely to depend on the natural disturbance regime and the stability and resilience of the communities.
* 6During day-to-day operation, underwater noise, emission of electromagnetic fields and collision or avoidance with the energy structures represent further potential impacts on coastal species, particularly large predators. The wider ecological implications of any direct and indirect effects are discussed.
* 7Synthesis and applications. This review demonstrates that offshore renewable energy developments will have direct and, potentially, indirect consequences for coastal ecology, with these effects occurring at different scales. Ecologists should be involved throughout all the phases of an ORED to ensure that appropriate assessments of the interaction of single and multiple developments with the coastal environment are undertaken.},

There has been recent progress applying this framework to the delivery of ecosystem services in land use planning. However, despite growing national and international interest in marine spatial planning, there is a lack of parallel frameworks in the marine realm. This paper reviews an ecosystem service tradeoff analysis framework and provides a more comprehensive synthesis for how it can be applied to marine spatial planning and marine ecosystem-based management. A tradeoff analysis approach can reveal inferior management options, demonstrate the benefits of comprehensive planning for multiple, interacting services over managing single services, and identify `compatible' services that provide win\textendash{}win management options.},

The effects of the farm on the coast, which can be instrumental in mitigating storm-induced erosion and thus contribute to coastal defence, are sometimes disregarded in selecting its location, possibly due to the inexistence of an ad hoc methodology. In this context, the objective of this work is to examine the influence of the farm-to-coast distance through a sensitivity analysis in a case study: Perranporth (UK). The impacts of a wave farm on the beach morphology are examined in four scenarios with different farm-to-coast distances using a high-resolution suite of numerical models. The results show that a wave farm closest to the beach offers the highest degree of coastal protection (up to 20\% of beach erosion reduction). The downside of this enhanced coastal protection is that the wave resource available at this location would be slightly smaller (approx. 10\%) than in the case of the wave farms further from the coast. More generally, we find that the farm-to-coast distance is a critical variable in determining the effectiveness of a wave farm for coastal defence.},

For coastal areas or some remote islands, marine tidal current energy is a promising renewable power source due to its high predictability. During the last decades, prototypes of various horizontal and vertical axis marine current turbines (MCT) have been developed around the world. Although reviews on MCTs can be found in some state-of-the-art research papers in the last few years, many of the reported MCT projects were only at the planning/design stage when the papers were written. In fact, some projects do not have any further developments during the several years after their first reporting; and others have already upgraded their original designs and adopted up-scaled versions. In this paper, up-to-date information on large tidal turbine projects over 500 kW is focused. The newest achievements of these large tidal current turbine technologies with their developing histories are presented. These technologies represent the industrial solutions for several pre-commercial MCT farm projects in the coming years. New developments in floating MCT technologies are also included. This paper provides a useful background for researchers in the tidal current energy domain and allows them to know the newest developments in large MCT projects around world.},

Countries with coastal regions have the advantage of the ability to utilize an extra source of renewable energy, that is, the energy from ocean waves. However, one of the major problems with wave energy is that it is location dependent, where many factors that increase its utilization potential are dependent on the feasibility of the locations. There is a lack of objective, relative and cognitive methods for the estimation of location suitability for ocean wave energy production. The present study attempts to address this lacuna and proposes a new method which is both objective and cognitive to identify suitable locations where the optimal amount of wave energy can be produced. The proposed method used the MCDM cascaded to ANN techniques to predict an index that directly represents the suitability of locations for wave energy generation. The index was applied to two different locations with varied levels of wave energy potential. The results encourage the authors for further application of the method.},

CSP technologies are divided into parabolic troughs, linear Fresnel reflectors, parabolic dishes, and solar towers. The process for developing EGE reservoirs is also explained in detail. Cellulosic ethanol energy extraction is explained for both cellulolysis and gasification.

  abstract = {Assessing and managing the cumulative impacts of human activities on the environment remains a major challenge to sustainable development. This challenge is highlighted by the worldwide expansion of marine renewable energy developments (MREDs) in areas already subject to multiple activities and climate change. Cumulative effects assessments in theory provide decision makers with adequate information about how the environment will respond to the incremental effects of licensed activities and are a legal requirement in many nations. In practise, however, such assessments are beset by uncertainties resulting in substantial delays during the licensing process that reduce MRED investor confidence and limit progress towards meeting climate change targets. In light of these targets and ambitions to manage the marine environment sustainably, reducing the uncertainty surrounding MRED effects and cumulative effects assessment are timely and vital. This review investigates the origins and evolution of cumulative effects assessment to identify why the multitude of approaches and pertinent research have emerged, and discusses key considerations and challenges relevant to assessing the cumulative effects of MREDs and other activities on ecosystems. The review recommends a shift away from the current reliance on disparate environmental impact assessments and limited strategic environmental assessments, and a move towards establishing a common system of coordinated data and research relative to ecologically meaningful areas, focussed on the needs of decision makers tasked with protecting and conserving marine ecosystems and services.},

  abstract = {Multi-use offshore platforms (MUPs) combining renewable energy from the sea, aquaculture and transportation facilities can be considered as a challenging way to boost blue growth and make renewable energy (especially wave energy) environmentally and socio-economically sustainable. MUPs allow sharing the financial and other market/non-market costs of installation and management, locally using the produced energy for different functionalities and optimizing marine spatial planning. The design of these solutions is a complex interdisciplinary challenge, involving scientists and technical experts with different backgrounds.
This paper presents a new methodology for the design of a MUP based on technical, environmental, social and economic criteria. The methodology consists of four steps: a pre-screening phase, to assess the feasibility of different maritime uses at the site; a preliminary design of the alternative schemes based on the identified maritime uses; a ranking phase, where the performance of the MUPs is scored by means of expert judgment of the selected criteria; a preliminary design of the selected MUP selected.
An example application of this procedure to a site offshore the Western Sardinia coast, Mediterranean Sea, Italy, is provided. In this site the deployment of a MUP consisting of wave energy converters, offshore wind turbines and aquaculture is specifically investigated.},

  abstract = {For Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) to become a viable alternative energy source, it must encompass large arrays of devices. Arrays may include 1000s of devices. The associated foundations or anchors may encounter a range of seafloor sediment types and geotechnical properties. Wave and tidal energy convertors induce unique loads on foundations and anchors that are different from other seafloor engineering applications. Thus, there is a need for a combination of advanced site analysis and performance assessment. Geotechnical engineering plays the vital role of ensuring that foundation and anchor systems perform successfully for MRE devices. Our paper reviews the unique frequency and magnitude of loading regimes experienced by MRE arrays. We examine potential loading conditions on the foundation-anchor systems. Loading regimes include environmental and system loads from single devices or arrays of devices. We present specific load examples from field data. We explore the applicable geotechnical approaches to address these conditions, including constitutive models that may or may not adequately capture the response of the seafloor sediments to the MRE loads. Partially to fully dynamic constitutive model formulations may be necessary to properly model sediment-fluid hydromechanical response to MRE loading. Spacing of full MRE arrays and spatial variability in sediment properties may require multiple foundation types.},
